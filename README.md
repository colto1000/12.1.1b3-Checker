# 12.1.1b3-Checker v2 for Noobs!
Checks to see if iOS 12.1.1 beta 3 is still being signed -- made <em>even more</em> super simple! <br />

All prerequisites will be checked for <em>(and installed if needed)</em> during the script! Hooray! <br />

<strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO:</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*\* <strong>u/01110101_00101111</strong> (GitHub: airsquared) for helping with MAJOR improvements in v2! \*\* <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>u/s0uthwes</strong> (s0uthwest) for fork of tsschecker <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>tihmstar</strong> for tsschecker and libpartialzip <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>r/jailbreak</strong> for being awesome <br />


If you are getting an error launching the script, try opening Terminal and type this: <br />
`chmod +x <drag file into Terminal>`

CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS ON <strong>macOS</strong>! <em>(looking for someone to port to Windows...)</em>
